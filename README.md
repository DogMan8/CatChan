<h1>Note</h1><br>
Chrome 48 may have a memory leak. Use chrome 50, 49 or 47 instead of 48 if you can. In my environment,<br>
- No leaks on Chrome 50.0.2630.1 canary SyzyASan.<br>
- No leaks on Chrome 49.0.2623.28 beta-m.<br>
- Leaks 1-2MB/hour on Chrome 48.0.2564.97 m.<br>
- No leaks on chrome 47.0.2526.111 m.<br>
You can test these using CatChan with the same setting 'active virtual boards in 4chan' in EasySetting.
<br>

Chrome 49 has a bug around ChannelMessage, memory will leak when you access other sites with CatChan. The tab will hang up after 3-7 days. When you use CatChan in a site and you don't access to other sites, memory won't leak. I reported this, https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=581335 <br>
<br>
How to reproduce the bug: (49.0.2623.0 canary)<br>
1. Install ChannelMessage.user.js. <br>
2. Open any page, for example, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Channel_Messaging_API/Using_channel_messaging<br>
3. Check amount of JS Heap using DeveloperTool. It's about 6-8MB probably. Don't forget to do GC before check.<br>
4. Click "START". Then messages are send and received continuously.<br>
5. Re-check amount of JS Heap. It's increasing. Don't forget to do GC before check.<br>
6. It will increase up to 2GB or more and the tab will hang up after 3-7 days. However, usage of virtual memory in system<br> DOESN'T increase. You can see this fact using process explorer.<br>
7. If you decrease size of messages to 100KB, memory doesn't leak so much. I tested cases of 200KB or 400KB, they behave about the same as the case of 100KB, it doesn't leak so much. I haven't found threshold.<br>
8. Now I tested version 50.0.2630.1 canary SyzyASan, the bug seems to be reproduced so far.<br>
<br> 
Chrome43 has a bug around DesktopNotification. If you encounter this bug, use canary version of chrome(chrome46) or stop using DesktopNotification. You can check this by pasting chrome_crasher.user.js to your console. Chrome will be crashed around 3275th DesktopNotificaton by the script.<br>
